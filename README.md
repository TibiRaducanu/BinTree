# BinTree

**Introduction**    
Thank you for taking the time to review our game. We were inspired by RPGs all throughout our childhood and we decided to develop a classic 2D Top-Down RPG. 

**Characters**  
This Unity project gives you the ability to assign/manipulate/create Characters in your game by the user the ability to control their movement in the scene and between scenes. For in-scene movement we use the Player Controller Script and for between-scene movement we use the Load New Area Script.

**Point To Point Movement**  
The Skeleton Patrol script uses an array of GameObjects Transformers in order to point out the locations of movement of an NPC or Enemy.

**Scripts**   
Can be found in **BinTree/BinTree/Assets/Scripts/**

Every script represents a C# class. The Scripts are attached to GameObjects and interact with the Unity Environment by using Tags.

**Bosses**  
Who doesnâ€™t like Bosses, right? Boss fights are an essential part to any Dungeon 2D RPG. In order to put up a challenge, the Player has to defeat a Boss which has a health bar.

**Prefabs**  
In order to adjust the complexity of the game, for every object that we need to use multiple times in the game, we make it a prefab. This means that we have saved an object with all of its components and as a result when dragging it in another scene it already has the behavior that we needed.
